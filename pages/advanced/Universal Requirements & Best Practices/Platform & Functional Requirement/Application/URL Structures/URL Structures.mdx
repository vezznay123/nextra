# Best Practice URL Structuring

**Priority**: High

## Overview

URL structuring is an important aspect of SEO and user experience. A well-structured URL helps search engines understand the content and context of a webpage, making it easier for users to navigate and share links. Optimised URLs are clean, descriptive, and easy to understand, improving the chances of the page ranking well in search engine results pages (SERPs) and increasing click-through rates.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Create Descriptive and Readable URLs

- **Use Clear and Concise Descriptions**: URLs should clearly describe the content of the page. Avoid using generic identifiers like numbers or unrelated strings of characters.
  ```
  https://www.example.com/shoes/women/sneakers
  ```
  This URL clearly describes the category and product type, making it easy for both users and search engines to understand.

- **Avoid Special Characters**: Avoid using special characters like `?`, `=`, and `%` in URLs. Instead, use hyphens (`-`) to separate words, which helps maintain readability and prevents issues during indexing.

### 2. Use Hyphens for Word Separation

- **Word Delimiters**: Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words in the URL instead of underscores (`_`) or spaces. Hyphens are easier to read for both search engines and users.
  ```
  https://www.example.com/makeup-brushes
  ```
  Hyphens improve readability and make URLs more intuitive for users.

### 3. Include Target Keywords

- **Keyword Relevance**: Include relevant keywords in the URL to help improve the page's SEO value. Keywords should reflect the content of the page and align with users' search queries.
  ```
  https://www.example.com/skincare/anti-aging-cream
  ```
  This URL includes relevant keywords that help search engines understand the content and make it more likely to match relevant search queries.

### 4. Keep URLs Short and Simple

- **Avoid Unnecessary Words**: Keep URLs concise by avoiding unnecessary words such as "and," "or," or "the." Shorter URLs are easier to read, remember, and share.
  ```
  https://www.example.com/hair-care/shampoo
  ```
  Short, relevant URLs improve usability and user experience.

### 5. Maintain a Consistent Structure

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Use a logical hierarchy for URLs to show the structure of the website. This helps users and search engines understand the relationship between pages.
  ```
  https://www.example.com/electronics/laptops/gaming-laptops
  ```
  A consistent structure helps users navigate and makes it easier for search engines to index related content.

### 6. Use Lowercase Letters

- **Lowercase URLs**: Always use lowercase letters for URLs. URLs are case-sensitive, and using uppercase letters can lead to issues with duplicate content.
  ```
  https://www.example.com/skincare-products
  ```
  Lowercase URLs ensure consistency and avoid potential issues related to duplicate content.

### 7. Avoid Dynamic Parameters

- **Static URLs**: Whenever possible, use static URLs rather than dynamic URLs with parameters (e.g., `?id=123`). Static URLs are more user-friendly and easier for search engines to crawl.
  ```
  https://www.example.com/clothing/men/t-shirts
  ```
  Avoiding dynamic parameters makes the URL more readable and predictable.

## Best Practices

- **Canonical Tags**: If multiple URLs lead to similar content, use canonical tags to point to the preferred version and avoid duplicate content issues.
- **URL Consistency**: Ensure that all URLs follow the same pattern across the website to improve navigation and help search engines understand your site structure.
- **Avoid Keyword Stuffing**: While it's important to include keywords in URLs, avoid overstuffing them. URLs should be readable and meaningful.

## Benefits of Optimised URL Structure

1. **Improved SEO**: Well-structured URLs with relevant keywords help search engines understand the content of the page, which can improve rankings.
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear, descriptive URLs make it easier for users to navigate, share, and remember links, leading to an improved user experience.
3. **Increased Click-Through Rates**: URLs that accurately reflect page content are more likely to attract clicks from search engine results pages.
