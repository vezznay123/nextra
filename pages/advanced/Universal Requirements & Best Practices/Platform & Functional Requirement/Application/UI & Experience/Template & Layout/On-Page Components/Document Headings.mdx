**Priority**: High

## Overview

Using proper heading structures is crucial for both SEO and user experience. Heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) help search engines understand the structure of the page and allow users to easily navigate through the content. Proper implementation of headings ensures that content is well-organised and accessible, which can improve rankings and make the page more user-friendly.

## H1 Heading Tag

- **Primary Heading**: The H1 heading tag should be styled as the largest and boldest font on the component design. It serves as the primary heading for the page and should clearly represent the main topic or content.
- **Formatting**: The content in the H1 tag should be formatted in Pascal Case, where each word is capitalised to improve readability and create a consistent appearance across the site.

## H2 Heading Tags

- **Content Division**: Multiple H2 tags may be present on a page. These headings should clearly describe distinct content sections, helping to organise the content into logical, digestible parts.
- **Relevance**: Each H2 heading should be thematically relevant to the main content of the page, providing clear context for the content it introduces.
- **Formatting**: Like the H1, content within H2 tags should also use Pascal Case to maintain consistency and improve the readability of the headings.

## H3 and Other Sub-Heading Tags

- **Sub-Headings for H2**: H3 tags should be used to create sub-sections beneath H2 headings. This helps in breaking down the content further and providing additional structure.
- **Descriptive Information**: H3 tags should act as precursors to more descriptive information about the section, providing users with an understanding of what to expect in the content that follows.
- **Formatting**: As with the other headings, Pascal Case should be applied to the text in H3 tags to maintain visual consistency and readability.

## Additional Information

- **Heading Nesting**: Proper nesting of heading tags is essential for accessibility and SEO. Always ensure that headings are used in a hierarchical manner, starting with H1 and proceeding sequentially to H2, H3, and so on. Avoid skipping heading levels, as this can confuse both users and search engines.
- **SEO Benefits**: Proper heading structures help search engines understand the content hierarchy, making it easier for them to crawl and index the page. This can lead to improved rankings and better visibility in search engine results.
