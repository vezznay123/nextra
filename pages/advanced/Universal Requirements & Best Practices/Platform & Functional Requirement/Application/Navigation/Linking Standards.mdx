# Linking Standards

**Priority**: High

## Overview

To ensure that search engine bots can effectively discover and index the website, it is important to use clean HTML links with descriptive anchor text. Clean links make it easier for search engines to understand the structure of the site and the context of the linked content, which improves both user experience and SEO.

## Best Practices for Linking

- **Use Clean HTML Links**: Always use clean and readable HTML `<a>` tags for links. Avoid using JavaScript-based links or links embedded within scripts or elements that may be inaccessible to search engine bots.
- **Descriptive Anchor Text**: Use descriptive anchor text that accurately conveys the content of the linked page. Avoid generic terms like "click here" or "read more." Instead, use meaningful phrases that reflect the destination page's topic.
- **Internal Linking**: Ensure that important pages on the website are internally linked in a logical structure. This helps search engines understand the hierarchy and importance of pages.
- **Avoid Broken Links**: Regularly audit links to ensure that none are broken. Broken links negatively impact both user experience and SEO.

## Example HTML Hyperlink

Below is an example of a clean HTML hyperlink with descriptive anchor text:

```html
<a href="/example-target-page">Example link text</a>
```

In this example, the link text "Example link text" describes the content of the linked page, making it easy for users and search engines to understand what the link points to.

## Benefits of Following Linking Standards

- **Improved SEO**: Descriptive anchor text helps search engines understand the context of linked pages, improving their relevance and ranking potential.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Clean and descriptive links make it easier for users to navigate the website and find what they are looking for.
- **Efficient Crawling**: Search engine bots can easily discover and index pages when clean HTML links are used, resulting in better overall crawl efficiency.

## SEO Impact

Following linking standards ensures that search engines can effectively crawl and index the site, while also providing context to the links through descriptive anchor text. This improves the relevance of linked pages, helping them rank higher in search engine results.
