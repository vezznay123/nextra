# HTML Sitemap

**Priority**: High

## Overview

An HTML sitemap is an important component for both users and search engines. It provides an organised structure of all the important category and brand URLs on the website, enabling easier navigation and enhancing site discoverability. A filterable HTML sitemap helps users to quickly find the pages they need while improving search engine indexing of key URLs.

## Structure and Layout

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Organise the sitemap in a hierarchical manner, with top-level categories and brands displayed prominently. Nest subcategories beneath their respective categories for better clarity. Adopt a deep structure spanning multiple depths to provide access to category content and supplier content, including listing pages.
- **Filterable Interface**: Implement filters that allow users to dynamically view specific categories or brands. This feature enhances usability by allowing users to easily locate the information they are looking for.
- **Pagination**: If the sitemap contains a large number of URLs, use pagination to keep it user-friendly and to avoid overwhelming search engines. This helps in maintaining good load times and efficient crawling.

## URL Inclusion Criteria

- **Canonical URLs**: Ensure that all URLs included in the sitemap are canonical. Avoid including duplicate or redirected URLs to maintain consistency and avoid confusion for both users and search engines.
- **Indexable Pages**: Only include URLs that are allowed to be indexed by search engines. Avoid adding URLs blocked by `robots.txt` or those with `noindex` meta tags.
- **Active and Relevant Pages**: Only add active and relevant category and brand pages to the sitemap. Exclude outdated or inactive URLs to maintain the sitemap's quality and usefulness.

## Adding the Sitemap to the Website

- **Global Footer Link**: Include a link to the HTML sitemap in the global footer of the website. This ensures that users can easily access the sitemap from any page, enhancing the site's overall usability.
- **CMS Management**: Manage the HTML sitemap through the content management system (CMS) to ensure that updates are efficiently handled and changes are consistently applied across the website.

## Benefits of an HTML Sitemap

- **Improved User Experience**: Users can easily navigate the site and find specific categories or brands through the sitemap, especially if it includes filtering capabilities.
- **Enhanced SEO**: An HTML sitemap helps search engines discover all the important URLs on the website. By organising the URLs hierarchically and ensuring only canonical, indexable pages are included, search engines can effectively crawl and index the site.
- **Efficient Crawling**: Providing a well-structured HTML sitemap ensures that search engine bots can efficiently crawl through the website, improving the likelihood of all important pages being indexed.

## Example HTML Sitemap Structure

### Top-Level Categories
- **Category 1**
  - Subcategory 1.1
  - Subcategory 1.2
- **Category 2**
  - Subcategory 2.1

### Brands
- **Brand A**
- **Brand B**

This hierarchical structure helps users and search engines easily understand the relationship between different sections of the website.
