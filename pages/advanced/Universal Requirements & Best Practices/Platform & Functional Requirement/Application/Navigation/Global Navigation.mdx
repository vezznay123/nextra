# Global Navigation Management

**Priority**: High

## Overview

To provide the Boots merchandising and SEO teams with enhanced control over landing pages, presentation order, and content integration, a custom module will be integrated within the CMS. This module will offer an intuitive interface that allows easy management of global navigation elements, ensuring flexibility and consistency across the website's navigation.

## Requirements

- **Server-Side Rendering for Global Navigation**: The global navigation should be rendered server-side and returned in the initial HTML response. This ensures faster load times, better SEO performance, and a consistent navigation structure, rather than relying on values fetched from an API to populate the navigation.

* **Hyperlink & Navigation Label Customisation**: Allow the customisation of hyperlinks and labels used in global navigation to ensure they are both user-friendly and SEO-optimised.
* **Category Selection & Ordering**: Provide a mechanism for selecting categories and controlling their order within the global navigation. This feature will help prioritise important categories and adjust their visibility as needed.
* **Subcategory Selection & Ordering**: Enable the selection and arrangement of subcategories within their parent categories, ensuring the navigation reflects logical and intuitive paths for users.
* **Content Asset Injection Slots**: Create ID-driven slots where merchandising and promotional content assets (e.g., promos and banners) can be dynamically injected into the navigation. This provides flexibility for marketing campaigns and targeted promotions.

## Validation

- **Item Limits**: Implement item limits within the global navigation to avoid overcrowding. These limits should respect the design and styling constraints of the global navigation, ensuring a clean and accessible layout.
- **Automatic Removal of Offline Categories**: Automatically remove categories that are offline from the navigation to avoid dead links. Additionally, implement an alert system within the platform to notify web managers of such changes, enabling timely updates.

## Example HTML Hyperlink for Navigation

Below is an example of a clean HTML hyperlink used for navigational purposes:

```html
<a href="/example-target-page">Example menu label</a>
```

The link should be clear and descriptive, making it easy for users to understand where they will be directed.

## Benefits of Enhanced Global Navigation Management

- **Greater Control for Merchandising Teams**: The custom module allows merchandising teams to easily manage landing pages and promotions, aligning them with current campaigns and priorities.
- **Improved SEO**: By customising navigation labels and links, the SEO team can ensure that the global navigation aligns with targeted keywords and optimises internal linking.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: A well-managed and customisable global navigation ensures that users can easily find what they are looking for, reducing frustration and improving overall site usability.

## SEO Impact

A well-structured global navigation helps search engines understand the site's hierarchy and importance of pages, leading to better indexing. Clear and descriptive links, combined with well-maintained category and content management, result in improved rankings and discoverability for key pages.
