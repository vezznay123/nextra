# Page Titles Implementation

**Priority**: High

## Overview

The HTML page title is a crucial on-page SEO element that helps search engines and users understand the purpose of a webpage. Page titles are displayed in search engine results as the clickable headline, and they are a major factor in determining search ranking and click-through rates. It is important to ensure that page titles are dynamically generated and accurately reflect the content of the page to provide the best user experience and maximise SEO benefits.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Dynamic Generation of Page Titles

- **Content-Specific Titles**: Dynamically generate page titles to match the specific content being displayed. For example, if the page is a product detail page, the title should include the product name, while category pages should have titles that reflect the category's content.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Embed the generated page title within the initial server-side rendered HTML response. This ensures that the page title is available to search engines as soon as the page is loaded, providing better indexing opportunities.

### 2. Title Tag Structure

- **Length and Keywords**: The page title should be between 50-60 characters in length to ensure it is fully displayed in search engine results. Include relevant keywords, ideally towards the beginning of the title, to maximise SEO benefits.
- **Brand Inclusion**: Include the website or brand name in the title tag to improve brand recognition and trust. The brand name should typically appear at the end of the title tag, separated by a vertical bar (`|`).
- **Example Structure**:
  - `[Primary Keyword] - [Secondary Keyword] | [Brand Name]`

## Best Practices

- **Uniqueness**: Each page on the website should have a unique title tag. Avoid duplicating titles across multiple pages, as this can confuse search engines and result in lower rankings.
- **Descriptive and Engaging**: Page titles should be descriptive and engaging, providing users with a clear idea of what they can expect from the content. This helps improve click-through rates from search engine results pages (SERPs).
- **Avoid Keyword Stuffing**: While keywords are important, avoid stuffing the title with multiple variations of the same keyword. Titles should read naturally and provide value to users.

## Benefits of Optimised Page Titles

1. **Improved Search Rankings**: Well-crafted page titles that include relevant keywords help search engines understand the content of the page, leading to improved search rankings.
2. **Increased Click-Through Rates**: Page titles are one of the first elements users see in search results. Engaging, descriptive titles are more likely to attract clicks, driving more traffic to the website.
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear, concise page titles make it easier for users to navigate through the website and find the content they are looking for.

## Conclusion

Implementing dynamic, content-specific page titles is a vital aspect of SEO that helps improve search engine visibility and user experience. By ensuring that each page has a unique, descriptive, and optimised title, the Boots website can achieve better search rankings, attract more traffic, and provide a more engaging experience for users.
