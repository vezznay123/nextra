# Hreflang Tags Implementation

**Priority**: High

## Overview

Hreflang tags are crucial for ensuring that search engines serve the correct language or regional version of your content to users in different locations. This is particularly important for international SEO, as it helps prevent duplicate content issues and ensures a better user experience for global visitors.

To effectively implement hreflang tags, they must be added to the `<head>` section of each page, indicating the language and regional targeting. These tags must be populated dynamically using values from the content management system (CMS) â€” in this case, Amplience.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Adding Hreflang Tags

- **Hreflang in `<head>` Section**: Ensure that hreflang tags are added in the `<head>` section of each page to clearly indicate the intended language and region for that page.
- **Dynamic Population from CMS**: The hreflang values should be dynamically generated using data from Amplience. This includes both the language and regional targeting information to ensure consistency across the website.

### 2. Example Hreflang Tag

Below is an example of hreflang tags that should be included in the `<head>` of a webpage:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-gb" href="https://www.boots.com/beauty-skincare/make-up" />
  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-ie" href="https://www.boots.ie/beauty-skincare/make-up" />
</head>
```

In this example, two versions of the page are defined, one for Great Britain (`en-gb`) and another for Ireland (`en-ie`). The URLs and language values need to be sourced from Amplience, ensuring accurate regional targeting.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. CMS Integration (Amplience)

- **Amplience Data Utilisation**: The CMS should be configured to store and manage the language and regional versions for each content page. These values will be used to generate the appropriate hreflang tags.
- **Automated Generation**: Set up an automated process in Amplience to generate the hreflang tags for each page based on its metadata. This ensures that any updates to the content or structure are automatically reflected in the hreflang tags, reducing manual errors.

### 2. Page Templates

- **Template Updates**: Update the page templates to include placeholders for hreflang tags. The placeholders will be populated dynamically using the values pulled from Amplience during the page generation process.
- **SEO Consistency**: Ensure that all pages, including category pages, product detail pages, and informational pages, include hreflang tags where applicable to maintain SEO consistency across the website.

## Benefits of Proper Hreflang Implementation

1. **Improved User Experience**: Ensures that users are served the correct version of the page based on their location and language preference, leading to a more tailored user experience.
2. **Better SEO Performance**: Correct hreflang implementation helps search engines understand the relationships between different regional versions, preventing duplicate content penalties and improving international search rankings.
3. **Streamlined Content Management**: By dynamically generating hreflang tags using Amplience, the process is streamlined, reducing manual workload and minimizing the risk of human error.

## Conclusion

For effective international SEO, implementing hreflang tags is crucial. By integrating Amplience to dynamically populate hreflang tags, the Boots website can provide a more consistent and optimised user experience for global visitors while enhancing SEO performance across different language and regional variations.
