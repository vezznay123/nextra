# Cache Validation

**Priority**: High

## Overview
Cache validation ensures that cached resources are kept up to date, improving efficiency by preventing unnecessary data transfers. By using validation mechanisms, servers can verify whether cached content is still valid, which reduces bandwidth usage and enhances performance.

## Server-Side Configuration

- **Generate ETag**: Calculate and include a unique ETag for each cacheable resource in the response header. This tag helps identify if the resource has changed.
- **Set Last-Modified**: Include the Last-Modified header with the resource's last modification timestamp. This allows the server to quickly determine if the resource has been updated.
- **Cache-Control**: Define caching behavior using the Cache-Control header, including directives like max-age and must-revalidate to manage cache expiry.

## CDN Rules (or Browser Behavior)

- **Store Metadata**: Cache the resource along with its ETag and Last-Modified values. This metadata helps determine whether the resource is still current during future requests.
- **Conditional Requests**: For subsequent requests:
  - Include the cached ETag in an `If-None-Match` header.
  - Include the cached Last-Modified value in an `If-Modified-Since` header.

## Handling Server Response

- **If 304 Not Modified**: Use the cached resource. This indicates that the cached version is still valid, and no new data needs to be downloaded.
- **If 200 OK**: Update the cache with the new resource and its metadata. This means the resource has changed, and the updated version must be stored.

## Benefits of Cache Validation

- **Reduced Bandwidth Usage**: By validating cached resources and only downloading changes, the server significantly reduces the amount of data transferred.
- **Improved Load Times**: Users experience faster page loads since the browser can reuse cached resources instead of downloading them again.
- **Enhanced Server Efficiency**: The server handles fewer full data transfers, reducing load and enabling better scalability.

## Example Cache Validation Scenario

- **Initial Request**: A user accesses a web page, and the resources (e.g., images, stylesheets) are downloaded with ETag and Last-Modified headers.
- **Subsequent Request**: The user's browser includes the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers in the request to check if the cached resources are still valid.
- **Server Response**: The server returns a `304 Not Modified` status, indicating that the cached resources can be reused.

## Crawler Accessibility
Cache validation helps ensure that crawlers always have up-to-date content while reducing unnecessary data transfers. This can help optimise crawl budgets by allowing search engine bots to focus on new content rather than re-downloading unchanged resources.

## SEO Impact
Effective cache validation contributes to better user experience by reducing page load times, which is a key factor in search engine ranking algorithms. Ensuring content is always fresh without unnecessary full downloads enhances both SEO and overall site performance.
