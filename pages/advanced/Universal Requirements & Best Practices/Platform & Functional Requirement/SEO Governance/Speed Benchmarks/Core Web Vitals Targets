# Core Web Vitals & Performance Scores

**Priority**: High

## Overview
Core Web Vitals are a set of user-centric performance metrics defined by Google to measure key aspects of user experience, including load performance, interactivity, and visual stability. Meeting Google's benchmarks for these metrics is critical for ensuring a good user experience and improving a page's ranking in search results.

## Core Web Vitals Metrics

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance.
  - **Good**: ≤ 2.5 seconds
  - **Needs Improvement**: 2.5 - 4.0 seconds
  - **Poor**: > 4.0 seconds

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability.
  - **Good**: ≤ 0.1
  - **Needs Improvement**: 0.1 - 0.25
  - **Poor**: > 0.25

- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Measures responsiveness.
  - **Good**: ≤ 200ms
  - **Needs Improvement**: 200 - 500ms
  - **Poor**: > 500ms

- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: Measures the time during which the page is blocked and unresponsive.
  - **Good**: ≤ 200 milliseconds
  - **Needs Improvement**: 200 - 600 milliseconds
  - **Poor**: > 600 milliseconds

- **New Interaction to Next Paint (NIP)**: Captures responsiveness by focusing on the single longest interaction.
  - **Good**: ≤ 300ms
  - **Needs Improvement**: 300 - 600ms
  - **Poor**: > 600ms

## Best Practices

- **Optimise Page Load Time**: Reduce the time it takes for the largest content element to load to improve LCP.
- **Minimise Layout Shifts**: Ensure that elements do not move unexpectedly during page load to keep CLS low.
- **Enhance Responsiveness**: Minimise input latency to keep INP within the 'Good' range.
- **Reduce JavaScript Blocking**: Optimise and defer JavaScript to minimise TBT.

## Example Metrics Analysis

- **LCP Example**: A hero image takes 1.8 seconds to load, which is within the 'Good' threshold.
- **CLS Example**: Unexpected changes in ad placement result in a CLS of 0.3, which requires improvement.
- **INP Example**: Button interaction takes 250ms, which falls in the 'Needs Improvement' category.

## Crawler Accessibility
Meeting Core Web Vitals benchmarks ensures a website is accessible to search engines and provides a positive user experience, resulting in better rankings and visibility.

## SEO Impact
Google uses Core Web Vitals as a ranking factor, making their optimisation crucial for SEO. Improving these metrics can lead to better user retention, higher engagement, and ultimately improved search engine rankings.
