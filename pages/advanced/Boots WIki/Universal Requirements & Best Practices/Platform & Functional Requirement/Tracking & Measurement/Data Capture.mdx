# Data Capture and Tracking

**Priority**: High

## Overview

To effectively track user interactions and derive meaningful insights, it is essential to implement data capture mechanisms that accurately record each page visit and enrich the captured data with relevant contextual information. When users visit category or product detail pages, tracking should include key dimension variables such as product categories (including subcategories) and supplier brand names.

## Tracking Requirements

### 1. Capture Page Visits with Contextual Data

- **Category Pages**: Each visit to a category page should trigger a tracking event that includes a dimension variable for the product category and any applicable subcategories. This data will help understand which categories users are most interested in and provide valuable information about browsing behaviour.
- **Product Detail Pages**: Visits to product detail pages must also trigger a tracking event, capturing a dimension variable containing both the category path and the supplier brand name. This information is crucial for understanding user preferences and optimising the presentation of products from popular brands.

### 2. Data Variables

- **Product Category**: Capture the product category name along with its full hierarchy (e.g., "Beauty > Makeup > Eyes > Mascara"). This ensures that the full browsing context is available for analysis.
- **Supplier Brand Name**: Capture the supplier brand name associated with the product. This data provides insights into brand popularity and helps evaluate brand-specific user engagement.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Tracking Setup

- **Example for Beauty Website**: For a beauty website, consider a product like mascara. When a user visits the category page for mascara, a tracking event should be triggered that includes the full category hierarchy, such as "Beauty > Makeup > Eyes > Mascara." If the user then visits a specific product detail page, such as "Volumizing Mascara by BrandY," a tracking event should capture the full category path and the supplier brand name (e.g., 'BrandY').

- **Tracking Library**: Use an analytics library such as Google Tag Manager or a custom solution to send tracking events with the required dimension variables.
- **Event Triggering**: Configure tracking triggers to fire when a user visits a category or product detail page. Ensure that the tracking events are sent immediately when the page is loaded to capture all user visits accurately.

### 2. Data Layer Integration

- **Data Layer Structure**: Implement a data layer structure that includes the necessary information for each page type. For example:
  ```javascript
  dataLayer.push({
    'event': 'pageview',
    'pageType': 'productDetail',
    'categoryPath': 'Beauty > Makeup > Eyes > Mascara',
    'supplierBrand': 'BrandY'
  });
  ```
  This structure allows analytics tools to easily access and use the information for reporting and insights.

### 3. Validation and Testing

- **Data Validation**: Ensure that tracking events are being captured correctly by validating the data sent for each category and product detail page. Test using browser developer tools or analytics debugging tools to verify that the correct dimension values are captured.
- **Regular Audits**: Perform regular audits to confirm that the tracking implementation remains consistent and accurate, especially after changes to the website's structure or analytics setup.

## Benefits of Enhanced Data Capture

1. **Improved Insights**: Capturing contextual data such as category hierarchy and brand names provides deeper insights into user behaviour, helping identify popular categories and products.
2. **Optimised Marketing**: With accurate data, marketing campaigns can be tailored to promote popular categories or brands, increasing engagement and conversion rates.
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Understanding user preferences allows for better personalisation and optimised content presentation, leading to a more satisfying user experience.
