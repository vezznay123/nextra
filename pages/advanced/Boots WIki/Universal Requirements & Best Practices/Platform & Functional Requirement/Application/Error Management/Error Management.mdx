# Error Management: 4XX Error Page

**Priority**: High

## Overview

Handling 4XX errors, particularly 404 errors, is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience and minimising the impact of broken links on SEO. A well-designed 404 error page helps users navigate back to meaningful content and prevents frustration when a page is not found.

## Best Practices for 404 Error Page Design

- **HTTP Status Code**: Ensure that the server returns a `404 Not Found` status code for non-existent pages. This helps search engines properly identify and handle missing pages.
- **Stay on Requested URL**: Load the 404 page on the same URL without redirection. This avoids confusion for users and search engines.
- **Clear Error Message**: Provide a friendly and clear message informing users that the page cannot be found. Use language that is approachable and not overly technical.
- **Call to Action (CTA)**: Include prominent CTAs to help users find other valuable content. Links to the homepage, popular pages, or support are good options.
- **Search Bar**: Include a search bar directly on the 404 page, allowing users to easily find what they were looking for.
- **No Canonicalisation**: Avoid adding a canonical tag on 404 error pages. This prevents search engines from misunderstanding the purpose of the page.
- **Analytics Tracking**: Implement tracking for 404 errors to monitor broken links and understand where users are encountering issues. This helps in proactively fixing broken links and enhancing the user experience.

## Example 404 Page Layout

### Elements to Include:

1. **Friendly Error Message**:
   ```
   Oops! The page you are looking for cannot be found.
   ```

2. **Call to Action Links**:
   - **Homepage**: A link back to the homepage to allow users to start fresh.
   - **Popular Pages**: Links to popular or recently updated pages to guide users to content that may be of interest.
   - **Support**: A link to contact support for further assistance.

3. **Search Bar**:
   - A search bar prominently placed on the page to help users find relevant content quickly.

4. **Visual Design**:
   - Include an engaging image or graphic to make the page feel welcoming rather than a dead end.

## Benefits of Effective 404 Error Management

- **Improved User Experience**: A well-designed 404 page helps users recover from errors gracefully, reducing frustration and bounce rates.
- **Enhanced SEO**: Properly handling 404 errors ensures that search engines understand which pages are missing, preventing potential issues with indexing.
- **Proactive Issue Resolution**: Analytics tracking provides insight into broken links, allowing for proactive fixes and improving the overall quality of the website.

## SEO Impact

Handling 404 errors correctly prevents duplicate content issues and informs search engines of missing pages. By including helpful navigation elements and avoiding redirects, users can quickly find what they need, improving both user experience and overall SEO performance.
