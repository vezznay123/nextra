# Social Integration: Twitter Cards

**Priority**: Medium

## Overview

Twitter Cards enhance the appearance of posts shared on X (formerly Twitter) by adding rich media elements, such as images, descriptions, and titles, that make posts more engaging. By adding Twitter Card mark-up within the `<head>` section of the page template, content shared from the site can be made more visually appealing and provide users with key information at a glance, ultimately driving higher click-through rates and engagement.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Add Twitter Card Mark-up

- **Placement**: The Twitter Card mark-up should be added within the `<head>` section of the page template. This ensures that when the page is shared, the relevant metadata is readily available for X to generate the Twitter Card.
- **Basic Mark-up Example**:
  ```html
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
  <meta name="twitter:title" content="Title of Page">
  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Brief description of the page contents">
  <meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.example.com/images/example-image.jpg">
  <meta name="twitter:url" content="https://www.example.com/example-page">
  ```

### 2. Dynamic Content Integration

- **CMS Integration**: Integrate the ability to update Twitter Card information through the CMS, allowing content teams to easily modify titles, descriptions, and images without needing technical intervention. The CMS should also allow for a hero image to be associated with each category, which can be reused across multiple locations, including the Twitter Card `twitter:image` field. The hero image should meet the required dimensions of 1200x628 pixels to ensure optimal display on social media platforms.
- **Rich Content**: Ensure that the metadata provided for Twitter Cards includes rich content, such as compelling images and descriptions, to make the shared post more appealing.

## Best Practices

- **High-Quality Images**: Use high-quality images for the `twitter:image` tag to make posts more visually appealing. Images should be optimized for fast loading.
- **Compelling Descriptions**: The `twitter:description` tag should include a compelling summary of the content, encouraging users to click on the post.
- **Testing**: Regularly use the [Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) provided by Twitter to test how Twitter Cards are displayed, ensuring that they are rendered correctly.

## Benefits of Twitter Cards

1. **Increased Engagement**: Twitter Cards make posts more engaging by including images, descriptions, and other rich elements, leading to higher click-through rates.
2. **Improved Branding**: Rich media content helps reinforce the brand's message and creates a professional appearance when content is shared on X.
3. **Control Over Presentation**: By providing metadata for Twitter Cards, the content team gains greater control over how pages are presented when shared on social media, ensuring consistency.

## Conclusion

Adding Twitter Card mark-up within the `<head>` section of the template enhances the appearance of shared posts on X, leading to increased engagement and better visibility. Allowing CMS control over these values provides flexibility, enabling content teams to easily update and optimize shared content for maximum impact.
