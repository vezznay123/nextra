# URL Structuring for Product Pages

**Priority**: High

## Overview

Product URL structuring is crucial for ensuring a consistent, user-friendly, and SEO-friendly format across different locales. For international e-commerce websites, it's important that product URLs follow a predictable and uniform structure, while maintaining clarity for users and search engines.

## URL Structuring Guidelines

### 1. Product URLs for UK Locale

- **Root-Level Path**: Product URLs for the UK should be accessible directly from the root of the site, with no locale-specific subdirectory.
- **Structure**: Include the product name in a descriptive and concise format, with words separated by dashes (`-`).
- **Formatting**: Use lowercase characters, and avoid special characters, stop words, or trailing slashes.

**Example**:
```
https://www.boots.com/product-url-example
```

### 2. Product URLs for Irish Locale (IE)

- **Locale-Specific Folder**: For the Irish site, product URLs should include a locale folder (`/ie/`) to distinguish them from the UK versions.
- **Structure**: Similar to UK product URLs, include the product name in a descriptive format with dashes (`-`) between words.
- **Formatting**: Maintain lowercase characters, avoid special characters, and keep URLs concise.

**Example**:
```
https://www.boots.ie/product-url-example
```

## Key Best Practices

1. **Descriptive URLs**: Ensure URLs provide a clear description of the product, making it easy for users to understand the content before clicking.
2. **Locale Specificity**: Use locale-specific paths (e.g., `/ie/`) to help both users and search engines differentiate between regional variations.
3. **Avoid Special Characters**: Keep URLs simple by avoiding special characters, stop words, and unnecessary parameters that might complicate indexing or usability.
4. **Consistency**: Consistency in URL structures across all locales helps provide a seamless experience, especially for international users.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines for product URL structuring, you ensure a clear, consistent, and user-friendly experience that improves both search engine visibility and usability. Separate root-level paths for UK products and locale-specific paths for Irish products make it easy for both users and crawlers to understand your site structure.
