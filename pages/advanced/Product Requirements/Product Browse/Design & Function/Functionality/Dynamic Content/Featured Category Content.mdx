# Design Pattern: Featured Content - Article Content Integration

**Priority**: Medium

## Overview

The Featured Content design pattern enables the integration of article content into product listing pages to provide additional information and drive engagement. By allowing the web team to specify an article category ID, related articles, which may contain richer content such as images, videos, or interactive elements, can be dynamically pulled from the content publishing platform into featured slots on product listing pages. This approach helps create a more informative and engaging experience for users, while also supporting SEO by enriching category pages with relevant, high-quality content.

## CMS Considerations

### Specifying Article Category and Target Pages

To ensure effective implementation, the CMS should include a dedicated field in the content publishing area where an article category ID can be specified, as well as the ability to select specific landing pages or categories for displaying the featured content. This flexibility allows the content management team to dynamically link related articles to multiple relevant pages based on the specified criteria. By leveraging this functionality, featured content can be easily managed and updated to reflect the current focus, promotions, or trending topics across multiple parts of the website.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Add Featured Content Slots to Product Listing Pages

- **Dynamic Article Integration**: Integrate featured content slots on product listing pages that can be populated dynamically based on an article category ID specified in the CMS. This allows the system to pull in:
  - **Category Pages**: General article content that aligns with the entire category.
  - **Category + Filter Paths**: Specific articles that align with particular filter combinations, such as brand or feature refinement.

- **CMS Integration**: The featured content slots should be fully manageable through the content CMS, allowing non-technical users to easily modify the article selection and content to reflect changes in product focus, promotions, or trending topics.

### 2. Contextual Content Based on Category and Filter Variables

- **Conditional Display**: Display articles dynamically based on the active category and filters on the page, such as product type or customer preferences.
  - **Example**: If the user selects the "Vegan" filter under the "Skincare" category, the featured content slot could display articles highlighting vegan skincare routines or benefits.

- **SEO Considerations**: Ensure that each featured article is relevant and optimized for SEO by including appropriate keywords and phrases that align with the category and filter context, which can help improve visibility in search engine results.

## Best Practices

- **Relevance**: Ensure that articles pulled into the featured slots are highly relevant to the selected category or filter path. Irrelevant content can detract from the user experience.
- **Avoid Overloading**: Keep the amount of featured content reasonable to avoid overwhelming users. Prioritize quality over quantity.
- **SEO Optimisation**: Tailor the article content to include relevant keywords based on the category and filter variables. This will help improve the page's relevance for related long-tail keyword searches.

## Benefits of Featured Content Integration

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Integrating relevant articles into product listing pages adds value for users, providing them with informative content that enhances their understanding and helps with decision-making.
2. **Improved SEO**: Including featured articles helps enrich the content of category pages, which can improve the page's quality and relevance in search engine results.
3. **Increased Engagement**: Well-curated featured content encourages users to explore related topics and engage more deeply with the website, potentially increasing time on page and reducing bounce rates.

## Conclusion

The Featured Content design pattern is a powerful way to enhance user engagement and SEO performance on product listing pages. By dynamically integrating relevant articles based on category and filter variables, the website can provide a richer user experience, improve search engine visibility, and guide users to helpful information that supports their purchasing decisions.
