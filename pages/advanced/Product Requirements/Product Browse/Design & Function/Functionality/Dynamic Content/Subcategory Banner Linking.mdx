# Algorithmically Driven Subcategory Banner

**Priority**: High

## Overview

The subcategory banner is an image-based sub-navigation component designed to dynamically showcase popular subcategories on category landing pages. Positioned above the product grid, the banner highlights subcategories based on their relevance, determined by sales volume and profit margin data. This approach helps guide users effectively to the most sought-after products, improving both the shopping experience and potential conversion rates.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Data & Logic

- **Algorithm Development**: Develop an algorithm that calculates a priority score for each subcategory based on sales volume and profit margin. The algorithm should assign greater weight to sales volume compared to profit margin, ensuring the most popular subcategories are featured more prominently.
- **Data Fetching**: Retrieve relevant subcategory data, including:
  - Hero image URLs (from Business Manager or CMS).
  - Calculated priority scores.
- **Sorting**: Order the subcategories based on their calculated priority scores, from highest to lowest, to determine their display order within the banner.

### 2. UI/UX Design

- **Image Card Layout**: Design a visually appealing layout for image cards that effectively showcases each subcategory.
  - **Hero Image**: Use a cropped rectangular version of the subcategory's hero image. This image should be taken from the hero image defined in the Business Manager or CMS.
  - **Anchor Text**: Provide clear and concise text linking to the respective subcategory landing page, guiding users to explore further.
  - **Responsiveness**: Ensure the image cards and overall layout adapt to various screen sizes and devices. The number of displayed cards should reduce from six on desktop to three on mobile for an optimized experience.
  - **Visual Hierarchy**: Maintain a clear visual hierarchy to ensure the most popular subcategories are given prominence, enhancing their visibility and user engagement.

### 3. Implementation

- **Component Creation**: Develop a reusable React component for the image card sub-navigation. The component should be designed to be flexible and easy to integrate into other pages if needed.
- **Data Integration**: Integrate the component with the backend data fetching logic, ensuring it dynamically populates the subcategory image cards based on the priority scores calculated.
- **Styling**: Apply consistent styling to the image cards and ensure they integrate seamlessly with the overall page design. The styling should align with the website's design system, ensuring a cohesive look.

### Example Workflow

1. **Data Processing**: Backend logic calculates subcategory priority scores based on sales volume and profit margin.
2. **Data Fetching**: Subcategory data, including hero images and scores, is fetched via an API.
3. **Component Rendering**: The React component receives the data, sorts the subcategories, and renders them in a visually appealing layout.

## Conclusion

The algorithmically driven subcategory banner serves to enhance the user's journey through dynamic and data-driven subcategory suggestions. By featuring high-priority subcategories prominently, this component aims to increase product visibility, improve engagement, and boost overall conversion rates.
