# Managing Empty (0 Product) Product Listing Pages Content

**Priority**: High

## Overview

Managing product listing pages that display zero products is essential for maintaining a seamless user experience and ensuring that search engines do not index empty or irrelevant pages. Redirecting empty product listing pages programmatically can help preserve website integrity, maintain SEO performance, and prevent users from encountering dead ends on the site.

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Programmatic 302 Redirect for Empty Categories

- **Redirect to Parent Category**: If a product listing page (PLP) lists zero products, the application should programmatically initiate a 302 redirect to the parent category URL.
  - **Example**: If `/beauty/makeup/mascara/eye-makeup/volumising` has zero products, redirect to `/beauty/makeup/mascara/eye-makeup/`.

- **Redirect to Homepage for Parent Categories**: If the empty category is already a parent category, initiate a 302 redirect to the locale homepage.
  - **Example**: If `/beauty/makeup/mascara` has zero products, redirect to `/` (homepage).

### 2. Reinstate the Category When Populated

- **Reverse the 302 Redirect**: If the previously empty category becomes populated with products, automatically reinstate the category and reverse the 302 redirect. This logic should be driven by the inventory count, acting as a condition for redirection.

## Example Redirects

- **Empty Parent Category Redirect**:
  ```
  /beauty/makeup/mascara = 0 product > 302 > /
  ```
- **Empty Subcategory Redirect**:
  ```
  /beauty/makeup/mascara/eye-makeup = 0 product > 302 > /beauty/makeup/mascara/
  ```
- **Empty Lower-Level Category Redirect**:
  ```
  /beauty/makeup/mascara/eye-makeup/volumising = 0 product > 302 > /beauty/makeup/mascara/eye-makeup/
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Temporary 302 Redirects**: Use 302 redirects rather than 301 redirects. A 302 redirect indicates a temporary change, allowing the category page to be reinstated when products are restocked without affecting long-term SEO.
- **Inventory Monitoring**: Implement automated checks to monitor inventory counts and trigger redirects accordingly. This ensures that empty categories are handled in real-time.
- **User Experience**: Redirect users to relevant categories or the homepage rather than leaving them on an empty page, ensuring they are not left with a negative experience.

## Benefits of Managing Empty Product Listings

1. **Improved User Experience**: Redirecting users away from empty product listing pages helps maintain a positive browsing experience, keeping users engaged and providing relevant content.
2. **SEO Preservation**: Empty pages can negatively impact SEO by leading to a high bounce rate or being flagged as low-quality content. Redirecting them helps maintain the overall quality of indexed pages.
3. **Efficient Use of Crawl Budget**: By redirecting empty pages, search engines can focus on crawling more valuable pages on the site, optimizing the use of the crawl budget.

## Conclusion

Proper management of empty product listing pages is crucial for preserving the overall user experience and maintaining SEO performance. By programmatically redirecting empty categories to parent categories or the homepage, and reinstating them when products become available, the website can ensure an optimal experience for both users and search engines.
