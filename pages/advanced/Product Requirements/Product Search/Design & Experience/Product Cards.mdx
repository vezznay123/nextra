# Product Listings Display Guidelines

**Priority**: Medium

## Overview

The presentation of product listings on category pages significantly impacts user experience and engagement. Consistent and well-organised product displays, adapted to various screen sizes, help improve navigation, usability, and visual appeal across all devices.

## Display Guidelines

### 1. Product Listings Per Page

- **Products Displayed**: On initial load of a category page or across a paginated page, display 60 product URLs.
- **Consistent Display**: Ensure that 60 products are displayed consistently across all device types (desktop, mobile, tablet).

### 2. Desktop Display

- **Number of Products**: 60 products displayed per page.
- **Layout**: Display 4 items per row for a balanced and visually appealing grid.

### 3. Mobile Portrait Display

- **Number of Products**: 60 products displayed per page.
- **Layout**: Display up to 2 items per row to optimise visibility and ease of navigation for mobile users.

### 4. Mobile/Tablet Landscape Display

- **Number of Products**: 60 products displayed per page.
- **Layout**: Display up to 3 items per row to make effective use of the wider screen space.

## Considerations for Product Count

Loading more than 60 products per page could lead to delayed load times due to increased payload size, negatively impacting performance. Conversely, loading too few products may limit the overall user experience and reduce shoppability, making it harder for users to browse the available range effectively.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Consistent Product Count**: Keep the number of products displayed per page consistent across all devices to avoid user confusion.
2. **Responsive Design**: Adapt the number of items displayed per row based on the device type (desktop, mobile, tablet) to optimise the user experience.
3. **Visual Balance**: Ensure a visually balanced layout with an appropriate number of items per row for each device type.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these product listing display guidelines, you can provide a consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices. A well-structured and visually appealing product listing layout helps users easily find what they are looking for, improving both usability and engagement.
