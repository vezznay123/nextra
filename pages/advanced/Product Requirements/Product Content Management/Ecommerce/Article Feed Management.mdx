### Article Tag IDs and Content Feed Integration

**Priority:** High

**Overview**
For a headless website, leveraging APIs to pull and push data seamlessly is crucial for enhancing content delivery and flexibility. The focus here is on developing an API-based solution that helps with associating articles with specific product categories and dynamically displaying related content. This integration will enhance user experience by providing relevant articles tied to specific product categories, ensuring users get more context and useful information.

**Implementation Requirements**

1. **Article ID-Based API Endpoint**
   - **Endpoint Development:** Develop an API endpoint within the Content Publishing Platform that accepts an article ID as input. The endpoint should return a structured JSON response containing the following details for the specified article:
     - **Hero Image URL:** Rendered URL of the hero image for use in the front end.
     - **Anchor Link to Article Content URL:** The URL to the complete article content for deep linking.
     - **Article Headline:** The title of the article, which will be used prominently in the display.
     - **Short Description:** A brief summary of the article content to entice users to click through.
   - **Related Articles Feed:** In addition to the main article details, return data for the 5 most recently published articles. Each related article should include the same information fields (hero image, link, headline, description).
   - **Output Format:** The response should be in a structured JSON format for easy consumption by the headless front end.

2. **Custom Field in Content CMS**
   - **Category Association Field:** Create a custom field within the Content Management System (CMS) to allow the web team to associate a product category with a specific article ID. This will help in tagging articles with relevant categories and facilitating better contextual recommendations on product pages.
   - **Dynamic Content Tagging:** The custom field should allow editors to easily select a product category from a dropdown or similar interface and link it to an article. This ensures the content team can efficiently manage which articles are displayed in relation to specific products.

**Content Integration Requirements**

1. **Front End Integration**
   - **Client-Side Rendering:** The JSON response from the API should be used to render article content on product detail pages, ensuring that users see dynamic and contextually relevant articles.
   - **Display Placement:** The articles should be displayed in a section titled "Related Articles" beneath the main product content. Each article should display the hero image, headline, and short description, with a clickable link to view the full article.
   - **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for the article content feed to avoid impacting page load performance. Articles can be fetched once the user scrolls to the "Related Articles" section.

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - **Cache API Responses:** Implement caching at the server or CDN level for API responses to reduce server load and ensure faster delivery of content. The cache should be invalidated whenever an article is updated in the CMS.

**Best Practices**
- **API Security:** Ensure the API is secure by implementing appropriate authentication and authorisation mechanisms.
- **Responsive Design:** Make sure that the related article section is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- **SEO Considerations:** Since the content is client-side loaded, make sure that critical information is still accessible for SEO purposes through appropriate structured data or pre-rendering.

**Benefits of Article API Integration**
- **Enhanced Content Relevance:** Dynamically displaying related articles helps provide users with more context, improving engagement and the perceived value of product pages.
- **Streamlined Content Management:** The CMS integration with a custom field allows editors to easily associate content, reducing manual work and improving efficiency.
- **Improved User Experience:** By showing contextually relevant articles, users are more likely to stay on the site longer, reducing bounce rates and encouraging exploration of related content.

**Conclusion**
Integrating article feeds via an API and associating them with product categories is an effective way to provide users with additional, highly relevant content. By leveraging a headless architecture and using client-side data rendering, this implementation ensures flexibility, SEO integrity, and an enriched user experience.
