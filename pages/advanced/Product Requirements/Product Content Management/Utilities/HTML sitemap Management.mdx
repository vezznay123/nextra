### HTML Sitemap Integration

**Priority:** Medium

**Overview**
An HTML sitemap is crucial for improving both user navigation and SEO by providing an accessible overview of all important pages on the website. It should combine hierarchical organisation of categories, brands, and articles to ensure comprehensive site coverage. As content is published across different CMS applications, a unified HTML sitemap will require integration through APIs for effective cohesion between eCommerce and article content.

**Implementation Requirements**

1. **Structure and Layout**
   - **Hierarchical Structure:** Organise the HTML sitemap hierarchically, with top-level categories (e.g., main product categories and brands) and subcategories nested beneath them. This structure should make it easy for users and search engines to navigate the site.
   - **Brand and Category Segmentation:** Separate sections for brands, categories, and articles should be provided, ensuring users can easily locate the type of content they need.

2. **URL Inclusion Criteria**
   - **Canonical URLs Only:** Ensure all URLs included in the sitemap are canonical versions to avoid duplication issues.
   - **Indexable Pages:** Only include URLs that are allowed to be indexed (i.e., do not include URLs blocked by `robots.txt` or with `noindex` meta tags).
   - **Active and Relevant Pages:** Include only active and relevant pages, excluding outdated or inactive URLs to keep the sitemap clean and useful for both users and search engines.

3. **CMS Integration**
   - **Separate Content Sitemaps:** As content is published in different CMS applications, generate separate HTML sitemaps for article content and eCommerce content. These sitemaps should then be combined into a unified HTML sitemap using API integration.
   - **API Integration:** Develop an API that can pull content from both CMS platforms and create a unified HTML sitemap. This ensures all relevant content is represented, and the sitemap stays up-to-date.

**Content Integration Requirements**

1. **Front End Integration**
   - **User-Friendly Display:** The HTML sitemap should be displayed in a way that is easy for users to navigate, with clear headers and sectioning for top-level categories, brands, and articles.
   - **SEO-Friendly HTML:** Ensure the sitemap uses proper HTML semantics to enhance crawlability, such as lists (`<ul>`/`<ol>`) for easy parsing by search engines.

2. **Maintenance and Updates**
   - **Automated Updates:** The sitemap should automatically update whenever new content is published, modified, or removed. This ensures that the sitemap remains accurate without manual intervention.
   - **Monitoring and Error Handling:** Implement monitoring to identify broken links or outdated URLs in the sitemap and provide a mechanism for automatic correction or notification for manual review.

**Best Practices**

- **Consistency:** Ensure consistent formatting across all categories, brands, and article sections to avoid confusion.
- **Link Depth:** Avoid excessive link depth within the sitemap; all important pages should be accessible within three clicks to improve user experience and SEO.
- **Mobile Accessibility:** Make sure the sitemap is mobile-friendly to cater to users accessing the site from different devices.

**Benefits of an HTML Sitemap**

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Users can easily locate pages of interest, especially for large sites with extensive categories and products.
- **Improved SEO:** The sitemap helps search engines efficiently crawl the website, ensuring all important pages are indexed and enhancing overall visibility.
- **Content Discovery:** A well-organised sitemap assists users and search engines in discovering both eCommerce products and article content, bridging the gap between different content types.

**Conclusion**
An HTML sitemap is a fundamental tool for enhancing navigation and SEO performance on the Boots website. By leveraging a hierarchical structure, integrating CMS content through APIs, and maintaining a consistent and user-friendly design, the sitemap will contribute to a better user experience and improved search engine visibility.
